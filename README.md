# Binary Search
It is a search algorithm that finds the position of an element in a sorted Array.
It looks at the middle of the array for the taget element if it is not found, it divides 
the array in half and focuses the search in the half where the target might be. The process 
is repeated until either the target is found or the array is empty. 

# Implementation 
The program that I have written takes two command line arguments.
The first argument is a txt file containg numbers and the second argument is the number we are looking for. 
The file is read line by line with each read storing the number in an array. Once the process of reading is
a function is called that searches for the target number using the binary search algorithm. 

# It is important to note that the numbers in the txt file must be sorted.
